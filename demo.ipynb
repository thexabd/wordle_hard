    "- Two wordle solvers for a 5-letter Wordle game as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Heuristic solver \n",
    "``HeuristicWordlePlayer``\n",
    "- Picks the guess based on **character frequencies**\n",
    "- A word scores higher if it is composed of common characters rather than rare characters\n",
    "- The worse and average number of guesses is **6** and **~3.82**, with the first guess as **\"raise\"**\n",
    "- Computes on-the-fly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Maximum Information Gain Solver \n",
    "``MaxInformationGainWordlePlayer``\n",
    "- Picks the guess based on **maximizing information gain**\n",
    "- A word scores higher if it generates the maximum Shannon entropy from its response distribution(the count of all possible response outcomes with respect to the available target words).\n",
    "- The worse and average number of guesses is **5** and **~3.65**, with the first guess as **\"react\"**\n",
    "- Computes slower and is optimized by pre-computation\n",
    "- Providing a larger word list as the guess list improves the average number of guesses to **~3.60** with the start word as **\"reast\", \"trace\"** etc\n",
    "\n",
    "### Users can...\n",
    "``interactive_play``:\n",
    "- Interact with the solvers to guess an unknown word by providing responses\n",
    "- Examine the performance of the solvers by providing different target words\n",
    "\n",
    "``check_first_guess_performance``, ``check_topK_guesses_performance``:\n",
    "- Specify different \"first-guess\" words and check the optimal first-guess against all target words\n",
